Feature Extraction and Classification on Wine and Abalone dataset

Classification and clustering on the Wine and Abalone dataset was done as part of my coursework at the University of Waterloo. 
Conducted exploratory data analysis on these datasets from Kaggle. Pre-processed the data to treat the missing data and outliers. Performed feature extraction such as PCA, LDA, t-SNE and implemented different models such as KNN, Decision Tree, Ensemble methods including Random Forests, Adaboost, XG-Boost, Gradient Boosting and compared their performances.

Steps implemented:
Technologies: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Data Preprocessings:
1. Checking for missing values.
2. Checking for duplicates records and dropping it.
3. Checking for outliers - Data point that differs significantly from other observations.
4. Balancing the imbalance dataset using RandomUnderSampler, RandomOverSampler
5. Normalizing data using z-score
6. Applying PCA, LDA and t-SNE on the datasets.
7. Used hyperparameter selection using K-Fold cross validation
8. Applying t-SNE method on both the dataset
9. Applied following machine learning algorithms on Wine, Abalone and PCA and LDA features of both the datasets:
       KNN
       Decision Tree
       Naive Bayes
       Random Forest
       Adaboost
       XgBoost
       GradientBoost
